Testing Java Discord library

The main code that interacts with Discord's API and Gateway is found here: https://github.com/dknoma/diskiyord/blob/master/src/main/java/diskiyord/ws/DiscordWebsocketAdapter.java

The entirety of this bot backend could possibly also be rewritten using Golang. That's an opportunity for a future project.
